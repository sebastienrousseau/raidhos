# RaidhOS UI (Tauri)

This folder is a placeholder for the Tauri desktop app. The UI will call
into the Rust core through Tauri commands and stream progress updates.

## Planned Structure

- `frontend/` for the web UI (HTML/CSS/TS)
- `tauri.conf.json` for app config
- Rust commands exposed from the UI crate
